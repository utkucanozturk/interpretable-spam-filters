# Interpretable Spam Filters

This project develops a predictive model to make classification of emails as spam or non-spam. The model was trained on a dataset provided by [University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). Our pipeline includes exploratory data analysis, hyperparameter tuning, model selection and model interpretation parts.

The code in this project is commited by [Utku Can Ozturk](https://github.com/utkucanozturk/) and [Cornelia Gruber](https://github.com/corneliagru).
